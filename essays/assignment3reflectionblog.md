1. Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)
My site is a store that sells different types of jewelry. We currently have diamond, gold, and pearl items for sale.

2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
For this assignment, I tried to do as much as I could possibly do, however, I do have some bugs left over from the last assignment although the site works really well now.

3. Describe what you are most proud of about your system:
For me, I appreciate the design of the system. What I mean by this is, that I've never had to make anything remotely close to a web application/an actual website with a server. I am just amazed at how everything is so intertwined with each other. From the login that goes back to the last page, to the cart where you can update the number of items almost live.

4. Describe what you are least happy with your system:
One thing I am not really happy with is the UI. I wish I set up a good base for the UI at the start if the project as I feel it would have made it look even better.

5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?
Assignment 3 was much more difficult and had me connect up a lot more things. Another thing that was super different was the approach. This time I actually thought things out instead of doing a more brute force method of coding.

6. When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?
I would first try to set it up and troubleshoot by myself and if I still couldn't figure it out I worked with professor port to really get that subject down.

7. Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?
I feel like what worked well for this assignment was the approach I had. Not only did I not try and brute force it but I also started working with professor port for the first time ever.

8. Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?
Something that did not work well for me in this assignment was the invoice emails. I say this because it was and is a hassle to try and test it on the ITM server.

9.What did you learn from doing this assignment?
I actually learned a lot and I really started to put the pieces together this assignment. I got a more in-depth grasp of server calls, post and get requests, services, and even learned that it is entirely possible for me to have a site that will email users.

10. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
The only thing I would change is the timing. I feel like I should've started earlier.

11. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
(a): 30%
(b): 30%
(c): 40%

12. Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)
I did not work with a group on this project.
