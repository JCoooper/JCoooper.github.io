For me, MIS is something that kind of runs in the family. My dad is currently a VP of Information Technology at Foodland and this degree is something that would support a career in IT management just like this. I feel like MIS and IT management is also something I personally like as I did grow up with it around me and I do have that thirst for knowledge around the subject. However, one thing I find more interesting than that is programming and development. This is the career path I would like to follow and MIS fits into this decently well for a software developer as I can understand what a business or cooperation needs and I am able to build it and understand why it is needed.
