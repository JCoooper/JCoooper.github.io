1. My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
This class was very valuable in terms of the fact that I can now officially add javascript to my “vocabulary”. I also think that the fact that we have learned the servers side of things is also very useful as I have only really known to program offline applications and projects. I think that it also needs to be said that I have shaved off some rust in terms of my way of thinking when it comes to programming.

2. I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
I feel like i still need to work off the rust i have accumulated and really buckle down to learn this new language. I feel like i need to take smaller things a little bit more seriously as i know these small things add up in the long run.

3. I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
I feel as if the WODs, while very taxing and time-consuming, have helped somewhat. I feel as if coding shouldn't really be a timed event like that as in the real world you wouldn't really have so little time. However, the repetitiveness of the WODs and the time constraint helped with smoothing out the development process. I have never really used the screencasts for the WODs.

4. The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
The labs in my opinion would have helped but ended up being a complete mess, especially at the end. The lab numbers were all out of order. The laulima turn-in spot sometimes wasn't even labeled with the lab number which made it just a little bit more difficult to turn in which is unnecessary. Some labs weren't even covered properly in class. In the beginning, the labs were helpful and were covered decently.

5. I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
This is very true as it is actually a longer project, which in my opinion is the best way for anyone to learn coding in the intermediate or even in some advanced cases. The project definitely lined me up ok for assignment 2. 

6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
I think that the class can be improved with more organization. I feel as if this is the biggest thing as if the labs covered a decent amount each time, the turn-ins were more clear and if students weren't thrown into a tornado of work and deadlines, it would help the learning curve to be a lot more smooth.

7. What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
I feel as the only thing that really helped and felt necessary for learning important code-related things are WODs and Labs/Projects like assignment 1. The screencasts were also good in case you were lost and are a good source of reliable information if/when needed.
