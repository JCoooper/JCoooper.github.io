1. Describe your design for your siteâ€™s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart. 

The shopping cart I intend to create will be one where, at least for now, cannot edit but will be carried over through different pages. If you buy a diamond necklace on the diamond page, when you go over to the gold page it will still be there.

2. Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, and what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session.

I will try and have the number of items be saved as a session which in turn can be used to be kept for a specific person. The data stored is going to be just the item amount as the specific data is carried through the query string.

3. How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?

I think the set of rules already in place where you cannot fully check out or go to the invoice without logging in or registering could keep this from happening. One security concern was actually brought up in assignment 2 where if you entered a certain number into the item amount field it would let you check out. However, I need to further research this issue. 

4. Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary)

I think to maintain a minimalist look, i will just add their name in place of the log in on the nav bar.

5. If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?

I am not working with partner unfortunately due to it being a little too late to get a partner.

6. How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?
	
  I am definitely starting earlier and i will be using techniques i have learned in the past like writing pseudo code of how i want things done and lay out the order and then filing in the code later.
