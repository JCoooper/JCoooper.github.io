This WOD was an interesting one because it relied so heavily on javascript. This WOD had us make a kind of invoice of sorts for items of our choosing and of a price of our choosing. The link is https://github.com/JCoooper/ITM352_S22_repo/tree/main/WOD/Invoice1. During this WOD it was not really too technically hard but it was very time-consuming as you had to edit a bunch of different variables and text. As well as style everything. This ultimately slowed me down in the end. Usually what I do to prepare is read over the instructions fully, then work on part of the WOD just to get the feel of what it is asking to do and how certain elements interact with one another and then I start the WOD. I tend to do this for every WOD as it really seems to help. For the next WOD I may need to prepare a little more by doing more in my “practice round”.
