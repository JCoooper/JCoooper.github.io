For these browserhistory WODS, I found them very challenging and also refreshing. Coming from the perspective of someone who has coded before and also someone who actually liked HTML and CSS and even thought of a career in front-end development, this was something that was fun and helped me shed off some rust i have accumulated over the years from not practicing. I also liked how it was challenging at the same time. However, while I like coding projects or assignments to be a little challenging, I did find the time limit idea was one that made unnecessary pressure and it did not give me enough time to soak in things. Rather I had to shallowly remember things and then regurgitate them rather than sitting down and crafting a website and then taking a look and admiring what you've just made. BrowserHistory1 was one of the easier ones but what made it challenging was the fact that this was the base of the rest of the WODs, meaning there was a lot of content to input and format. This took me 18 minutes which got me an AV time. BrowserHistory2 was a little more simple because it was just styling the elements from the previous WOD, I got this in 11 minutes. BrowserHistory3 was a little more challenging because it had us go deeper into CSS, I did this in 12 minutes. The last WOD or BrowserHistory6 took me 40 minutes and I would say more than 15-20 minutes was spent trying to look for a mistake that turned out to be a character mismatch, meaning some “”’s were not the same as typing them in. This WOD took me the full 40 minutes almost exactly.
